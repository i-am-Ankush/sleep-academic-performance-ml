# Sleep & Academic Performance

This is a small machine learning project  
The goal for the project was to see how sleep patterns affect academic performance and to build a simple regression model.

## What I Did

- Cleaned the dataset (converted text answers to numbers)
- Did some basic EDA (plots, correlations)
- Trained two models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Checked performance using MAE and R²
- Looked at which sleep factors matter most

## Key Points

- Sleep quality, night wakeups, fatigue → stronger impact on performance  
- Total sleep hours matter, but less than expected  
- Linear Regression worked better than Random Forest here  
- Survey data is noisy, so accuracy isn’t very high

## Files

- `analysis_final.ipynb` → clean notebook for review
- `analysis_raw.ipynb` → my rough project notebook with trials and errors
- `Student Insomnia...csv` → the dataset

## How to Run

Just open the notebook and run all cells from top to bottom.
